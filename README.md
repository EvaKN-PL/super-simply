# super-simply
This repository contains Terraform code to provision a basic, highly modular web server infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This project follows best practices by leveraging Terraform Modules for clarity, reusability, and separation of concerns (networking, security, and compute).

| Layer       | Component        | Description                                                                                      | Terraform Module |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Networking   | VPC & IGW        | The backbone (10.0.0.0/16). Includes the Internet Gateway for external connectivity.             | modules/vpc      |
| Subnetting   | Public Subnet    | A single subnet (10.0.1.0/24) designed to host public-facing resources.                         | modules/vpc      |
| Security     | Security Group   | An essential layer that acts as a stateful firewall for the EC2 instance, limiting exposure.     | modules/security |
| Compute      | EC2 Instance     | The actual compute resource (t3.micro), running a self-installing web server.                   | modules/ec2      |

📦 Module Breakdown

The infrastructure is broken down into three distinct modules, improving readability and future extensibility.

1. modules/vpc

Responsible for setting up the foundational network topology:

    1. Create the VPC.

    2. Provisions the Internet Gateway and attaches it to the VPC.

    3. Defines the Public Subnet and associates it with a Route Table directing external traffic through the IGW.

2. modules/security

Focuses solely on the security layer:

    1. Creates a dedicated Security Group (SG).

    2. The SG configuration explicitly allows TCP 22 (SSH) and TCP 80 (HTTP) inbound traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0), and allows all outbound traffic.

3. modules/ec2

Handles the deployment of the compute resource:

    1. Deploys the aws_instance into the Public Subnet.

    2. Attaches the necessary SSH Key Pair and the outputted Security Group ID.

    3. Employs user_data to automatically install and start the Nginx web service upon launch.      


⚙️ Prerequisites & Configuration

Before execution, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

    1. Terraform CLI (v1.0+): Installed and accessible in your path.

    2. AWS CLI: Configured with sufficient access permissions (keys in ~/.aws/credentials).

    3. SSH Key Pair: An SSH key must be created in your target AWS region and its name specified in terraform.tfvars.

    4. .gitignore: Ensure your sensitive file (terraform.tfvars) is excluded from version control.

🛠️ Deployment Steps (Terraform Workflow)
1. Configure Variables

Create a file named terraform.tfvars in the root directory and populate it with your environment-specific values.
```
# terraform.tfvars
# Environment Configuration
aws_region          = "eu-central-1" 
key_name            = "your-existing-ssh-key-name" # REQUIRED: Name of the key pair in AWS
instance_type       = "t3.micro" 

# Networking Configuration
vpc_cidr            = "10.0.0.0/16"
public_subnet_cidrs = ["10.0.1.0/24"] 
```
2. Initialization

This command downloads the AWS provider and initializes the local modules (vpc, security, ec2).

<pre> ```bash terraform init ``` </pre>
